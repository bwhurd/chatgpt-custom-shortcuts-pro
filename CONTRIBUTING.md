# Contributing

I use this extension daily and keep fixing it as ChatGPT UI changes break things. Help maintaining it is welcome.

Bug fixes are the most useful, especially small, focused fixes that restore broken shortcuts or UI hooks.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo  
2. Create a clearly named branch  
3. Make the smallest change needed  
4. Open a pull request with a brief explanation  

No CLA, no process overhead. I handle releases and direction. If you want to help long term, open an issue or reach out.
