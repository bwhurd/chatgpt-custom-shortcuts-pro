# ChatGPT Custom Shortcuts Pro

This is the source repo for ChatGPT Custom Shortcuts Pro, a Chrome extension that adds configurable keyboard shortcuts and small UI tweaks to ChatGPT.

I keep this extension updated as ChatGPT evolves, but maintaining it solo is getting harder. This repo exists in case others are interested in helping maintain or improve it. Contributions are welcome.

- No ads, tracking, or analytics. Everything runs locally  
- Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-custom-shortcuts/figoaoelbmlhipinligdgmopdakcdkcf  
- Changelog: CHANGELOG.md

## Features

- Scroll and navigate conversations

- Send, edit, regenerate, or branch messages  
- Switch models and Thinking modes  
- Dictation and Temporary Chat controls  
- Sidebar, model picker, and layout tweaks  
- Import, export, and reset settings  

For the full feature list, install the extension and open the settings panel.

## Issues or Breakage

ChatGPT changes frequently and UI updates can break shortcuts. If something is not working, open a GitHub issue or use the Chrome Web Store support link. I usually ship fixes within days.
